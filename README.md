# 🐄 HerdHealth AI – Cow Disease Detection System  

HerdHealth AI is a deep learning-based web application that detects cow diseases from images, helping farmers quickly identify **healthy or infected** cows. The system leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained on Kaggle’s **Lumpy Skin Disease Cow Images** dataset and provides real-time predictions.  

Developed by **Me(Sithum De Zoysa)** and **Chandupa Ambepitiya** from the **Department of CSE**, this project was built alongside the **Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI**.

## 🚀 Features  

👉 **Image-based Disease Detection:** Upload a cow image to determine if it is infected or healthy.  
👉 **Deep Learning Model:** CNN-based classification trained on **Google Colab with a T4 GPU**.  
👉 **User-friendly Web Interface:** Built with **React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**.  
👉 **Flask Backend:** Handles model inference and API requests.  
👉 **Runs Locally:** Set up on your own machine for testing and usage.  
👉 **Future Goal:** Develop real-time disease detection using **farm-mounted cameras**.

## 🔍 How It Works  

1️⃣ **Upload an Image** – Users upload an image of a cow through the web interface.  
2️⃣ **Image Processing** – The backend preprocesses the image and sends it to the trained **CNN model** for inference.  
3️⃣ **Prediction Output** – The app displays whether the cow is **healthy** or **infected** based on model results.

## 📊 Model Performance  

The CNN model was trained on **3200 images** with **80% training and 20% validation split**. Early stopping was used to optimize performance.  

### **Results:**  
👉 **Training Accuracy:** ~99%  
👉 **Validation Accuracy:** ~85%  

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements  

👉 **Deploy on Cloud (AWS/GCP) for remote access**  
👉 **Optimize model for real-time inference**  
👉 **Integrate IoT cameras for automated disease detection on farms**
